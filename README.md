## 🔍 Filters, Sorting, and Logging Implementation

### Employee Filtering & Sorting

- When retrieving employees, **sorting by `name` or `hiredate` is required**.  
- All other filter options are **optional**.


---

### Logging

- Logs are recorded **only when a user is logged in**.
- Currently, the endpoints allow anonymous access (`[AllowAnonymous]`), but logs will capture user activity when authenticated.

---

## ⚙️ Business Rules & Assumptions

- You **must create a department first before creating an employee**.
- The API currently allows unauthenticated access, but production systems would typically restrict access with a token.
